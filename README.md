## My process

### Built with

-   Vite
-   fetch API
-   Github API
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   Tailwind CSS
-   DaisyUI (React Component Library)

### What I learned

Completing this project taught about the nuances of contacting a 3rd party API (including headers, user tokens, etc.) and the magic of React component libraries. DaisyUI made some of the design aspects much more simple and was quite easy to use, I'm looking forward to using it more in the future.
I also learned quite a bit about conditional rendering and how to make webpages respond in the way I want using some simple logic and ternary operators.
